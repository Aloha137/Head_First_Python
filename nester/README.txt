“““This is the “nester.py" module, and it provides one function called print_lol() which prints lists that may or may not include nested lists.”””
def print_lol(the_list):

“““This function takes a positional argument called “the_list", which is any Python list (of, possibly, nested lists). Each data item in the provided list is (recursively) printed to the screen on its own line.”””
